## Overview

Revert Lend is a decentralized lending protocol that utilizes Uniswap V3 positions as collateral. Users can deposit assets into the protocol's vault and receive yield-bearing shares. These shares can then be used as collateral to open leveraged Uniswap V3 positions and borrow assets against them.

The protocol aims to provide capital efficiency by enabling users to put their idle assets to work as liquidity in Uniswap pools, while still maintaining exposure to those assets through borrowing against the yielded liquidity positions.

## Key Components

The core components that make up the Revert Lend protocol include:

1. **V3Vault**: The main vault contract that holds user deposits, manages Uniswap V3 positions, and handles lending/borrowing functionality.
2. **V3Oracle**: Contract for fetching price data from Chainlink price feeds and Uniswap V3 time-weighted average prices (TWAPs).
3. **InterestRateModel**: Calculates variable interest rates for supplied and borrowed assets.
4. **Automator Contracts**: A set of contracts that enable automated position management, such as auto-exiting, auto-compounding, and auto-ranging Uniswap V3 positions.
5. **Transformer Contracts**: Contracts that facilitate leveraging and deleveraging of Uniswap V3 positions, as well as atomic swaps and liquidity management.

## Audit Scope

The audit covered the following core contracts and their associated libraries:

- V3Vault.sol
- V3Oracle.sol
- InterestRateModel.sol
- Automator contracts (AutoExit.sol, Automator.sol)
- Transformer contracts (AutoCompound.sol, AutoRange.sol, LeverageTransformer.sol, V3Utils.sol)
- Utility contracts (FlashloanLiquidator.sol, Swapper.sol)

## Key Findings

The audit identified several potential issues and areas for improvement, including insufficient slippage handling, frontrunning risks, inaccurate fee calculations, and vulnerability to donation attacks. Recommendations were provided to address these issues, such as implementing checks for slippage conditions, adhering to the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, validating pool prices, and introducing a minimum total supply threshold.

Additionally, suggestions were made to optimize certain aspects of the codebase, such as using OpenZeppelin's EnumerableMap for managing owned tokens and incorporating SafeMath to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows.

## Centralization Risks and Architecture

While the Revert Lend Protocol is designed to be decentralized, there are certain aspects that introduce centralization risks:

- Automated Position Management: The protocol includes automator contracts that enable automated management of Uniswap V3 positions. These automators are controlled by Revert Finance, introducing a centralized point of control over user positions.

- Oracle Dependencies: The V3Oracle contract relies on Chainlink price feeds and Uniswap V3 TWAPs for price data. While Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network, the Uniswap V3 TWAPs are specific to the Uniswap protocol, introducing a dependency on a centralized exchange.
- Protocol Upgradability: The protocol contracts are likely to be upgradable, which means that Revert Finance or a designated governance process could potentially introduce changes to the protocol's behavior or logic in the future.

## Findings

| Severity | Findings          |
|----------|-------------------|
| Critical | 0                 |
| High     | 3                 |

## Conclusion

The Revert Lend Protocol is an innovative lending platform that leverages Uniswap V3 positions as collateral, enabling capital efficiency and yield generation. While the audit identified several areas for improvement, the provided recommendations aim to enhance the security, robustness, and overall reliability of the protocol. Addressing these findings and implementing the suggested mitigations will be crucial for the successful deployment and operation of the Revert Lend Protocol.
