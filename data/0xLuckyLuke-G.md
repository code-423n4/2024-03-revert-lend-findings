Given that all calculations within the specified code lines are deterministic and can be computed prior to deployment, it is advisable to pre-calculate these values and embed them directly into the smart contract code. This approach is particularly beneficial for constants, as it eliminates the need for on-chain computation during contract execution, significantly reducing gas costs. Furthermore, since the contract is not upgradable, these pre-calculated constants will remain constant throughout the contract's lifecycle, ensuring efficiency and consistency. This method has been repeatedly employed to optimize gas usage, demonstrating its effectiveness in saving substantial resources.
